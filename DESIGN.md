http://di.unfccc.int/time_series.
From this link all relevant data can be found. Time series data for every type
of greenhouse gas and emissions per sector for every country can be found here.

The data is given in excel files (.xls). For CO2 the data is given in kilotons
(kt) and for the other gasses in equivalent kilotons of CO2.
