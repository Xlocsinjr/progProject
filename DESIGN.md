### Data
##### Data sources
- http://di.unfccc.int/time_series.
From this link all relevant data can be found but only for the UN nations.
Time series data for every type of greenhouse gas and emissions per sector
for UN countries can be found here.

- http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=42FT2012
This link leads to data for GHG emissions in a larger number of countries but
only includes the time series for CO2, CH4, N2O and F-gasses but no information
on emission source. The same datasets are also available with emission per
capita and per GDP for every country.

- https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD
From this link, time series data for GDP for countries over the years can be
found.

- https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#emissions-by-sector
At emissions by sector. Here a data file can be found for GHG emission for countries
mostly in the years 1990 to 2010. Some countries do have data for years outside this
range but then it is only for certain sectors.

##### Data reworking
The data for GHG emissions is given in excel files (.xlsx).
For CO2 the data is given in kilotons (kt) and for the other gasses
in equivalent kilotons of CO2 (kt CO2 equivalent).

The data for the GDP is a csv, which can be directly read by d3, but could first
be converted to a json.

All data sources should be trimmed to only contain the relevant data. Then the
data files can be saves as .csv after which a script can create usable jsons for
the visualisations.

For the world map GHG emissions: China dominates with their high GHG emission
which means all other countries are barely coloured.

##### json structure
```
[

    year: 1970,
    countryCode:  
    {
      Name: Country name
      GDP: value USD,
      GHG: value kt CO2 equivalent
      sector1: value kt CO2 equivalent,

    },
    countryCode:

       GDP: value USD,
       GHG: value kt CO2 equivalent
       sector1: value kt CO2 equivalent,
       sector2: value kt CO2 equivalent,
     }
   }
 }
... etc
]
```

###### Grouped bar chart
- Bars can either be grouped by sector and have the countries identified by colour,
or the bars can be grouped by country and have the sectors identified by the colour.


### Scripts and functions
##### Scripts
- convertCSV2JSON: A script to convert a datasource to json in python.
- A script for the graphs in JavaScript
##### Functions
- NOTE: every interactive element will have its own update function
- function updateScatterYear: This function updates the scatter plot to data
from a different year.
