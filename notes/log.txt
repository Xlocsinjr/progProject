are meant to tell.

- Trying to figure out how datamaps plugin works.
- Presentations:
get index.html link in github.
Arrange dataset on year first then country.
Next step: get data sorted out. (This should have been the first step.)

- convert datasources to csv
- convert the csv to json: json per visualisation?
- been able to create a json (though not correct) holding only the names and GDP
of every country of every year from the GDP data. Next step is to add the GHG
emissions.
- Tried to change the json to hold GHG emission data but the script reads the
values in scientific notation (ex: 1.31E+01) as a string. This must be converted
to float or int first.
