- Set up first project proposal

#### 09-01-2018    w1 tuesday
- Worked on project proposal
- Failed to propose a good project.
The pie chart does not tie in well with the overall story the rest of the charts
are meant to tell.

#### 10-01-2018    w1 wednesday
- Revising the project proposal.
Replace pie chart with scatterplot relating a country's GDP to its GHG emission
- Working on the design document.

#### 11-01-2018    w1 thursday
- Daily standup:
UN countries data. Country removal via dropdown. Possible issues with country
names in different datasets.
- Trying to figure out how datamaps plugin works.

#### 12-01-2018    w1 friday
- Trying to figure out how datamaps plugin works.
- Presentations:
get index.html link in github.
Arrange dataset on year first then country.
Next step: get data sorted out. (This should have been the first step.)

#### 14-01-2018    w1 sunday
- convert datasources to csv
- convert the csv to json: json per visualisation?
- been able to create a json (though not correct) holding only the names and GDP
of every country of every year from the GDP data. Next step is to add the GHG
emissions.
- Tried to change the json to hold GHG emission data but the script reads the
values in scientific notation (ex: 1.31E+01) as a string. This must be converted
to float or int first.

#### 15-01-2018    w2 monday
- Daily standup: Made a start in creating a usable json. By the end of this week
all data should be usable and at least the world map and scatterplot should
work.
- Got the world map working with real data.
- Note: Still have to add GDP tot the json
- Somehow 2012 data isn't added to the json
- World map data is (seems?) correct now, with GDP and GHG emission data from
1970 to 2012 available in json format.
