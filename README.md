## Problem
Relate the greenhouse gas emissions of the world by source and type of gas.

## Solution
Visualization for greenhouse gas emission by country over time, greenhouse gas
emission by source, and the fractions of greenhouse gasses emitted from the
total greenhouse gas emission.

- The greenhouse gas emission by country over time can be visualized by a map
chart coloring the countries by either their total greenhouse gas emission
or the greenhouse gas emission per capita. The time element of this
visualization can be interactive, by having the user have control over a
range slider or a scroll bar that determines which data of which year will be
shown.

- The greenhouse gas emission by source can be visualized by a bar chart.
Unless a source is later found to plot the chart for different countries, this
chart will not be linked to the other visualizations.

- The fractions of greenhouse gasses emitted from the total greenhouse gas
 emission can be visualized by a pie chart.
