## Problem
Relate the greenhouse gas emissions of the world by source and type of gas.

## Solution
Visualization for greenhouse gas emission by country over time, greenhouse gas
emission by source, and the fractions of greenhouse gasses emitted from the
total greenhouse gas emission.

###### Features
- The greenhouse gas emission by country over time can be visualized by a map
chart coloring the countries by either their total greenhouse gas emission
or the greenhouse gas emission per capita.

- The time element of the greenhouse gas emission by country over time
 visualization can be interactive, by having the user have control over a
range slider or a scroll bar that determines which data of a year will be
shown.

- The greenhouse gas emission by source can be visualized by a bar chart.

- The fractions of greenhouse gasses emitted from the total greenhouse gas
 emission can be visualized by a pie chart.
